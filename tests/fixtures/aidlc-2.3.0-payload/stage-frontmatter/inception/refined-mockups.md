# Refined Mockups & UX Design

MANDATORY: Follow stage-protocol.md for approval gates, question format, and completion messages.

## Steps

### Step 1: Load Agent Personas

Load aidlc-design-agent persona from `agents/aidlc-design-agent.md` and knowledge from `.kiro/knowledge/aidlc-design-agent/`.

### Step 2: Load Prior Context

- Read rough mockups from `<record>/ideation/rough-mockups/` (if exists)
- Read user stories from `<record>/inception/user-stories/`
- Read requirements from `<record>/inception/requirements-analysis/`

The workshop scope skips rough-mockups by design (no Ideation phase); when the wireframes and user-flow inputs are absent, design the refined mockups directly from the user stories and requirements — never invent the content of a missing artifact.
